Question: Can we predict human walking movement **in time for exoskeleton response**? How does using data from both feet change/enhance the problem?

Predicting walking type 
- upstairs (1) + 2 feet
- downstairs (2) + 2 feet
- walking (3) + 2 feet
- misc (4) + 2 feet

METHODS
Data pre-processing
A. Filtering
- Filter out gravity (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4414.pdf)
- Filter out high frequency noise (how to determine this? Peak detection - threshold?)

B. Sectioning
- Section by stride?
- Section by 50 ms time window?

Predictions
- By stride: 1 prediction at end of stride of terrain type
- By rolling window: continuous predictions â€” use model with memory?

A. LDA 
i. LDA similar to what Roman did (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7955077&tag=1) 
 - Section by stride
B. SVD
C. RandomForest/Boostin/etc
D. Neural Nets (RNN)
E. Look in literature to see what has been done for these types of problems, and what could be improved

RESULTS
Figures:
i. Pre/Post filtering
ii. Prediction accuracies for A, B, C, D, E
iii. Prediction accuracies for A, B, C, D, E using only 1 foot
iv. Prediction accuracies by stride and by rolling window for A, B, C, D, E
