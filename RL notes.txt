state space: min angle to max angle
action: plantar force

goal:
1) standing
2) + 1 if angle changes at right time; - 1 if it doesn’t



Roboteq code
Sets parameters
Sets time for DF? and PF? (plantar flexion? Dorsal flexion?
Sets max PF power, max dorsiflexion (DF)

Sets starting state: controlled dorsiflexion
Sets heel strike time at 0


Starts loop at top:
- sets time as current time
- sets statetimer
- if time > 0:
	- get acceleration, gyro, motor accel, encoder position, encoder velocity, power
	- if at time mod 4 (certain point in cycle?)
		- set values to prior value (i.e. accv[4] = accv[3]);
		- resetsums and varCounter
	- if heel strike:
		- change power and timing based on last step

State machine
- Do diff stuff based on if state is reached
- State = -1 ==> starting state
- set state = 3 if statetimer>1000 (means nuetral ankle)
- state = 0 ==> heel strike, start dorsiflexion
	- once DF limit reached, start plantarflexion
	- set state = 1
- leave plantar flexion according to criteria, 
	- set state = 2 ==> swing state
- leave swing and go to heel strike if heel hits and swing long enough
	- set state = 3 —> update values —> set state = 0 (heel strike)
