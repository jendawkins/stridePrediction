Project:
Question: Can we control an exoskeleton for walking in a similar way as Hamaya et. al. controlled arm robot?

Program bipedeler walker (why did I do this?? As exercise in remembering reinforcement learning??)

Need: robot states and human states
- use human states from bipedlar walker or OpenSim?
(OpenSim gives forces over walking cycle, that’s about it)

Methods
- PILCO algorithm 
	- Paper uses open source code, but that’s in MATLAB currently—would have to translate it to Julia
(novelty? two feet maybe? but we don’t actually have that data)
