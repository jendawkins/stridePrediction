Calf muscle produces a force parallel to the leg

While in plantar flexion, the calf muscle is the primary driver of forward force

Hypothesis: plantar flexion has a unique accelerometer signal that corresponds to the force applied by the calf muscle

Proposal: Train a model to predict the force that will be applied at plantar flexion based on the 1) signal data of the past (i.e. rolling window with RNN) and 2) stride up to that point (i.e. model with memory only of the current stride)

Use traditional machine learning models and compare with newer models that can incorperate more signal memory

BENEFITS OVER LAST PROPOSAL: Has the potential to be **subject specific** and a bit self-training; given a normal walking pattern, and a subject’s weight/height the plantar flexion signal should be relatively constant 
- Put the person in the exo, allow them to walk, let the exo train off of their data and their plantar flexion, and then the exo can begin to predict 

Methods: 
1. Analyze data to find plantar flexion & plantar flexion force; define set of parameters to characterize this signal (if this can’t be done, just use video to mark plantar flexion and assume force will be calculated another way (like EEG)).

2. Using training data with marked force and force magnitude of calf, train model to predict how much force participant will exert for each step, in real time
A. LDA and feature selection (traditional method) over each stride
B. LDA and feature selection over rolling window (likely not to work very well, but good to show)
C. LSTM over each stride
D. LST over rolling window (hypothesized to work best)
